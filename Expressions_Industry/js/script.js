For this expressions practice I decided to make it about my current job. It is holiday season and we are offering great
deals on our high-end line of haircare products. A lot of money goes into the research and development of Loreal's
Kerastase line of products and the pricepoint for the products indicates that. Because the products are expensive,
the holiday season is a great time to offer discounts that make them more affordable.
