/*
For this expressions practice I decided to make it about my current job. It is holiday season and we are offering great
deals on our high-end line of haircare products. A lot of money goes into the research and development of Loreal's
Kerastase line of products and the pricepoint for the products indicates that. Because the products are expensive,
the holiday season is a great time to offer discounts that make them more affordable.

We offer holiday bundles, and the individual products at discounts. This will work to compare a holiday bundle that contains 3 products
at a discount as well as the three individual products at their discounted products.

alert("3 Products are on sale for the holiday season. The same 3 products come in a bundle that is also on sale for the holiday season. Which is a better deal?");

var itemPrices = [prompt("What is the price of the first product?"),];
