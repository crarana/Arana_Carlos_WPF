alert("My personal expressions exercise revolves around the amount of money I spend annually on tolls.");

var tollCost = prompt("How much is the toll cost?"); //To asses the cost of each toll being passed for work.
var times = prompt("How many tolls do you pass on your way to work?"); //To find out how many tolls are passed each trip
var workWeek = prompt("How many days do you work a week?"); //to learn how many days are worked per week

var shiftsYear = Number(workWeek) * 52; //how many days per year are worked

var timesPerWork = Number(times) * 2; //each trip to and from work crosses how many tolls
